# üöÄ Leak Sniffer

A fast and efficient Streamlit-based web application for searching domain-related data breaches and leaked credentials from MongoDB collections. This tool helps security professionals and researchers quickly identify potential security exposures for specific domains.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Fast Multi-threaded Search**: Utilizes concurrent processing to search across multiple MongoDB collections simultaneously
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Clean and intuitive Streamlit-based UI
- **Bulk Data Export**: Download search results as CSV files
- **Real-time Results**: Live display of search progress and results
- **Domain-based Filtering**: Search for specific domains across all available leak databases
- **Optimized Queries**: Efficient MongoDB queries with field projection for better performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Backend**: Python 3.x
- **Data Processing**: Pandas
- **Concurrency**: ThreadPoolExecutor

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- MongoDB server running (local or remote)
- MongoDB collections containing leak data with the following schema:
  ```json
  {
    "Domain": "example.com",
    "URL": "https://example.com/login",
    "Username": "user@example.com", 
    "Password": "password123"
  }
  ```

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LkSniffer.git
   cd LkSniffer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure MongoDB connection**
   
   You can configure the MongoDB connection in several ways:
   
   **Option 1: Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/"
   export DATABASE_NAME="Test"
   export MAX_WORKERS="16"
   ```
   
   **Option 2: Edit config.py**
   Modify the values in `config.py` according to your setup.

## üéØ Usage

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run Leaksniffer.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

3. **Search for domain leaks**
   - Enter a domain name (e.g., `example.com`)
   - Click the "Search" button
   - View results in the interactive table
   - Download results as CSV if needed

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MONGO_URI` | `mongodb://localhost:27017/` | MongoDB connection string |
| `DATABASE_NAME` | `Test` | Name of the MongoDB database |
| `MAX_WORKERS` | `16` | Number of concurrent threads for searching |

### MongoDB Setup

Ensure your MongoDB instance contains collections with leak data. The application will automatically discover and search all collections in the specified database.

**Expected document structure:**
```json
{
  "Domain": "target-domain.com",
  "URL": "https://target-domain.com/path",
  "Username": "user@target-domain.com",
  "Password": "leaked-password"
}
```
